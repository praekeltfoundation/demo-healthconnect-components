# COVID Vaccine Acceptance Poll

This is a poll that asks questions related to the COVID-19 vaccine. It has 2 main goals:
1. Get data around vaccine hesitancy in the population, and what the drivers of hesitancy are
2. Get information about the user, which can later be used for targeted messaging in order to reduce hesitancy

It is implemented as a RapidPro flow.

## Data collected
The fields that are being collected are:
- Vaccine willingness
- Vaccine motivation (what is motivating them to get the vaccine)
- Vaccine hesitancy (what is causing them to be hesitant)
- Vaccine recommendation to others
- Age category
- Gender
- Province
