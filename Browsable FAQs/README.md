# Browsable FAQs

This is a [Turn Stack](https://whatsapp.turn.io/docs/index.html#stacks) that integrates with an instance of [Content Repo](https://github.com/praekeltfoundation/contentrepo) to provide a browsable FAQ.

A browsable FAQ provides a structure to navigate content organised in a tree structure.

This flow allows you to drill down into a specific piece of content that you are looking for, and then navigate back up to one of three points:
- The main menu
- The topic option that you chose on the main menu
- The parent of the content you're currently viewing

## Data collected

## Changelog
